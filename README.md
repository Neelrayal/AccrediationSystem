## Description
This project was a part of my college curriculum where I had to implement a web app which can perform CRUD functions. I implemented the web app using ado technology.

The universities will upload their applications using this portal and will wait their applications get checked out by the higher authority. The higher authority will have the admin access  to the applications which users have submitted and they will accrediate them after going through their applications.

#### Technologies

- Ado.net
- Html, CSS
- Visual Studio
